<h1 id="toc_0">Inversion</h1>

<p>The algorithm we will perform is the powerful <code>mergesort</code>, but in each step of the merging phase we will count the inversions. Taking advantage of the fact that the two arrays \(\mathbf{l}\) and \(\mathbf{r}\) that we are comparing at each step \(k\) are already sorted in non-decreasing order, we have that if \(\mathbf{l}_i &gt; \mathbf{r}_j\) then this implies that \(\mathbf{l}_i &gt; \mathbf{r}_m\) for all \(m &gt; j\).</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Pseudocode</h2>

<p>The pseudo-code of this algorithm will consists of two functions, <code>count_inversions</code> and <code>merge_inversion</code>. The former is the main, recursive function that uses the <code>merge_inversion</code> as a sub-method. To understand the pseudo-code let us consider a simple example of a list: <code>A=[3,1,2,4]</code>, which has only one inversion. The <code>count_inversions</code> function will recursively split <code>A</code> into halves until it reaches the \(K\)-th step when \(A_K\) is of length 1. At that point it exits the recursion and simply returns the list \(A_K\) itself and a pseudo-inversion count of \(0\). At all other steps it returns the output from <code>merge_inversion(left,right,inv_left,inv_right)</code> - a list sorted in non-decreasing order and the cumulative count of inversions.</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">def count_inversions(A):
    if len(A) = 1
        # In case we are already at final divisions:
        return A, 0
    else:
        # For all other steps k&lt;K:
        middle = len(A)/2 
        intialize left, right
        for x in A up to middle: 
            add x to left 
        for x in A after middle: 
            add x to right 
        left, inv_left = count_inversions(left) 
        right, inv_right = count_inversions(right) 
        return merge_inversion(left,right,inv_left,inv_right)</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>merge_inversion</code> function implements the \(k\)-th step logic: <em>mergesort</em> and <em>counting inversions</em>. The latter works in the same way it always does, it compares two elements <code>left[0]</code> and <code>right[0]</code> and appends the output list <code>combine</code> by the smaller value. How inversions are counted should be straight-forward to see as well: when comparing <code>left[0]</code> and <code>right[0]</code> suppose we have <code>left[0] &gt; right[0]</code>, so we have encountered an inversion. Then this implies that since <code>left</code> is already sorted in non-decreasing order the <code>inversion</code> counter should be incremented by the length of <code>left</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">def merge_inversion(left,right,inv_left,inv_right):
     # Initialize:  
    combine = []
    inversion = 0
    # Merge and count inversions:
    while len(left) != 0 and len(right)!=0:
        if left[0] &gt; right[0]:
            add right[0] to combine
            add len(left) to inversion
            remove right[0] from right
        else:
            add left[0] to combine
            remove left[0] from left
    endwhile
    # Take care of remaining elements:
    while len(left) != 0:
        add left[0] to combine
        remove left[0] from left
    endwhile
    while len(right) != 0:
        add right[0] to combine
        remove right[0] from right
    endwhile
    # Add them all up:
    total_inversion = inversion + inv_left + inv_right
    return combine, total_inversion</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="toc_2">Example</h3>

<p>Below we have sketched a schematic example of how the algorithm works. On the left in black we show the <em>divide</em> phase. Individual rows show the \(K\) steps we need to divide (and then again to conquer). In blue we have sketched the <em>conquer</em> phase. Green annotations show where inversions occure and in red have added a simple iterator that counts the inversions at each step \(k\) and the sum of all of them above. </p>

<p>Note that the bottom row of the <em>divide</em> phase is also our first point of action of the <em>conquer</em> phase. We compare adjacent lists two each other, all of which have just one elements. Sorting them and counting inversions is very simple. We find two inversions - \(3&gt;2\) and \(9&gt;7\) - and for each of them we increment the iterator by \(+1\).</p>

<p>At the next step we have three lists so we just merge the first two. Here we first compare \(2\) - at position \(i=0\) - to \(1\) at position \(m=2\). We find that \(2&gt;1\) so we have encountered an inversion. But this time we increment the iterator by \(m-i=+2\) since \(3\) is also greater than \(1\). Once again we also sort the elements we look at. </p>

<p>It should be straight-forward to see that in the remainder of the divide phase we find no more inversions and that we therefore end up with \(4\) inversions in total.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Complexity</h2>

<h2 id="toc_4">Proof of correctness</h2>

<p><strong>Case where \(|A| \le 1\):</strong></p>

<p>In this case it is trivial that the algorithm is corrects since we will jump straight to </p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">if len(A) = 1
    # In case we are already at final divisions:
    return A, 0</code></pre></div>

<p>so the algorithm correctly returns 0.</p>

<p><strong>General case</strong> </p>

<p>We will prove by induction. Suppose we are at the \(k\)-th step of the algorithm and assume that in all previous steps the number of inversions have been computed correctly and list \(A_k\) is sorted correctly. At the step \(k\) we then split \(A_k\) into <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>. Then we have already demonstrated above how the <code>merge_inversion</code> will correctly merge <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> and increment the <code>inversion</code> counter. Applying the principle of mathematical induction we conclude that the algorithm is correct.</p>
